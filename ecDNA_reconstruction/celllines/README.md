#### 1. Reconstructions for published cell lines CHP212 and TR14

Here we compare the reconstruction of Decoil against Shasta and already validated breakpoints.<br/>
We use hg38 for the analysis -> https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_43/GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz
