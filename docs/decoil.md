# 1. Decoil development

## 1.1 Decoil
Decoil implementation for reconstructing ecDNA structure heterogeneity from sequencing data is available freely on Github https://github.com/madagiurgiu25/decoil-pre. <br/>

## 1.2 Decoil-viz
Decoil-viz for visualizing the amplicon threads and summarize the genomic regions on the amplicon is available on Github https://github.com/madagiurgiu25/decoil-viz. <br/>
Decoil-viz 1.0.3 release available on https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10785693.

## 1.3 Linear models comparison to deconvolve ecDNA elements from simulated overlapping fragments data
