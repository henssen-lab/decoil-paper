This analysis generates in-silico mixtures at different ratios and reconstructs co-occurring ecDNA elements using Decoil.

- Generate in-silico mixtures
- Reconstruct ecDNA elements in mixtures
- Aggregate all found SVs for downstream analysis

```
cd ../ecDNA_mixtures

# create environment
bash install.sh

# Generate mixtures, reconstruct ecDNA in mixtures and aggregate results
bash runs.sh
